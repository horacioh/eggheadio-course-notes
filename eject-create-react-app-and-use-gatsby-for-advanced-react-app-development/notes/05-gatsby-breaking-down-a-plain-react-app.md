## Notes

With our Gatsby project set up, let's compare it to an app created with Create-React-App.

Open the [Pokedex App on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-jepsen-1zqmb).

We have a homepage, an About Page, a Profile page with fake login, and a Stats page. There is also a public Pokemon display.

## ðŸ¤” Exercise

Recreate the routes and screens in [the example Pokedex built with Create-React-App](https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-jepsen-1zqmb) in our Gatsby app following the processes we've learned so far.
