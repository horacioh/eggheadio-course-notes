### Scaling a GraphQL API

- ðŸ”‘ The focus should be on creating value as soon as possible

- In GraphQL there is no way to query for all fields automatically. If we want to have a field on the response, we have to define it explicitly in the response

```js
  type Image {
    url: String
    description: String
    thumbnailUrl(width: Int, height: Int): String
  }

  type Product {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    description: String
    image: String @deprecated(reason: "Use \`imageObject { url }\`.")
    imageObject: Image
  } // ðŸ‘†  Add the depracted directive
  ...
```

Once all your potential users have been migrated to the latest version of your application, you can swap the `imageObject` and `image` return types

```js
  type Image {
    url: String
    description: String
    thumbnailUrl(width: Int, height: Int): String
  }

  type Product {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    description: String
    image: Image // ðŸ‘ˆ swapped
    imageObject: Image @deprecated(reason: "Use \'image\'.") // ðŸ‘ˆ swapped
  }
  ...
```
