# Flexbox Fundamentals

## Combining the Flexbox Sizing Properties Using the Flex Shorthand

Flex shorthand is super cool but might cause some weird things to happen in your browser. Garth Braithwaite explains in his tutorial that further expounds on the previous lesson titled *Using `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` to Make Flexbox Children Resize Correctly*.

### NOTE: Flex shorthand makes flexbox sizing consistent, but watch out for the defaults!

## Flex Shorthand â€“ What Is It Telling The Browser?

Although this is mentioned at the end of the tutorial, let's start thinking about the flex property with a value of one, or `flex: 1;`.

In the example, we're telling the browser to let Heading 1 display with a `flex-grow` of one, a `flex-shrink` of one, and a `flex-basis` of zero. As a result, you're going to see that the this element will have children that grow to use all the container space evenly.

See below and in minute [01:27](https://egghead.io/lessons/flexbox-combining-the-flexbox-sizing-properties-using-the-flex-shorthand#t=84) of the tutorial:

```
h1 {
    flex: 1;
}
```

Clean enough, but what this shorthand code is actually saying to the browser is in the commented out code. Take a look:

```
h1 {
    flex: 1;
    /*  flex-grow: 1;
        flex-shrink: 1;
        flex-basis: 0px;
    */
}

```

Now, let's take a look at the shorthand examples Garth provides in the tutorial. The commented out code has been removed.

### Example 1
````
.title-1 {
    background: #dd5f40;
    flex: 1;
}
````
What is this code telling the browser:

### Example 2
````
.title-2 {
    background: #3d483a;
    flex: 20px;
}
````
What is this code telling the browser:

### Example 3
````
.title-3 {
    background: #468e5d;
    flex: 0 80px;
}
````
What is this code telling the browser:

`flex-grow` `flex-shrink` `flex-basis`
