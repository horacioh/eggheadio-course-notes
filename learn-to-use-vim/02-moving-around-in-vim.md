# Moving around in Vim

## Moving in a file

Moving inside vim is done by using a few specific keys: `H`, `J`, `K` and `L`

Vim also provides a faster way to move the cursor. You can move through text word by word with the keys `W` and `B`

## Keys

- `J` moves the cursor down
- `K` moves the cursor up
- `L` moves the cursor right
- `H` moves the cursor left
- `W` moves the cursor forward one word at a time
- `B` moves the cursor backwards one word at a time

## Personal Comment

You can also move by using the arrow keys, but as Mike mentioned in the video, the keys set for movement in vim, make it easier, since your hands don't need to travel that far.
