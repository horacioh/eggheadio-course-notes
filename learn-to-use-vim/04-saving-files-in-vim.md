# Saving Files in Vim

## Saving Command

To save a file we can activate the command mode by pressing `ESC` then use the command `:write` or `:w`.

If we started vim without a file name, vim will give a `No File Name` error. But we can specify a filename and extension to save the file.

### Example

`:w my_file.txt` will save our contents inside the `my_file.txt`.
