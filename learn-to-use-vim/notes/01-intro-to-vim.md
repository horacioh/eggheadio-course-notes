# Intro to Vim

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/misc-intro-to-vim)**

## Basics

### Start vim

You can start vim, by opening the terminal and by typing `vim`.

### Command Mode

You can enter commands with `:`

### Exit vim

Enter the command mode and type `quit` or `q` then press enter.

_Note: With command more and the quit command you will have `:quit`._

## Personal Comment

Some operating systems don't come pre-installed with Vim, but come with `vi`. Vim means VI Improved, so all the commands learned in this course will work in `vi` as well.
