# Vim's different modes

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/misc-vim-s-different-modes)**

## Available Modes

Vim has three available moves:

- command mode (`--NORMAL--`)
- insert mode (`--INSERT--`)
- visual mode (`--VISUAL--`)

## Command Mode

This is the default mode that vim starts and where we write commands. You can see if you are in the command mode, by looking at the bottom bar and check if it says `--NORMAL--`. 

A command will always need to follow a `:`. 

To enter this mode, we need to press the `ESC` key.

## Insert Mode

This is the mode where we can insert text. You can see if you are in the insert mode, by looking at the bottom bar and check if it says `--INSERT`.

To enter this mode, we need to press the `I` key.

## Visual Mode

This is the mode where we can select blocks of text. You can see if you are in visual mode, by looking at the bottom bar and check if it says `--VISUAL--`.

To enter this mode, we need to press the `V` key.

## Keys

- `ESC` enter command mode
- `I` enter insert mode
- `V` enter visual mode
