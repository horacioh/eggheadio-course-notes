# Combining Vim commands

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/misc-combining-vim-commands)**

## Building commands

Vim commands are built in three parts:

- an action
- a location
- a second location (context)

Vim sees tests as an object that can be manipulated.

## Key Combo Trick

- Delete text in between <div> tags by using the keys `C`-`I`-`T`.
- Delete text inside quotation marks by using the keys `C`-`I`-`"`.
