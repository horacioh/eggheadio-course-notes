# Copy and Paste inside of Vim

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/misc-copy-and-paste-inside-of-vim)**

## Keys

- `Y` to copy/yank the selected text in visual mode
- `D` to cut the selected text in visual mode.
- `DD` to cut the entire line

## Notes

- Vim has its own clipboard, so copying or cutting text will not be added to the system clipboard.
- Deleting (key `D`) acts as cut
- Copying text is called "yank"
- Visual mode is extremely helpful if we want to do any sort of copy/paste of text
