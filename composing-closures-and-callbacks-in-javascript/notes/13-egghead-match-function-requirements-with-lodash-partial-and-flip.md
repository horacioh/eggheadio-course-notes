# Match Function Requirements with Lodash Partial and Flip

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-match-function-requirements-with-lodash-partial-and-flip)**

- Is useful to know that if you don't have a lot of control over some function APIs, and you want them to fit into your patterns, there are many helpful functions in `lodash` that can help you manage applying individual arguments, changing the order of arguments, and other helpful utilities.

- `partial` let you create multiple unary functions from a multiple variable function to supply arguments one at a time.
- `flip` let us change the order of the arguments to meet our needs (like in the partial example with `createInterval`)
