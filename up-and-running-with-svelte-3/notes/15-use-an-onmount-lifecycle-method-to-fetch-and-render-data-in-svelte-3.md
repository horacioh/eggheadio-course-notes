- Svelte provides functions that can be run at kdy moments during the component&rsquo;s lifecycle
- `onMount` runs after a component is first rendered to the DOM.
- In this example we use the `onMount` function to fetch data asynchronously and while we wait for the function to return with its data Loading text is displayed.
