- If we have a Box component, but we want to put any content we want inside of it we&rsquo;ll need to use a `slot`.
- A slot allows a Svelte component to have children of any sort.
- You can define default children by putting content with the slot

  ```
  <slot>
      Hey, I am the default text!
  </slot>
  ```
