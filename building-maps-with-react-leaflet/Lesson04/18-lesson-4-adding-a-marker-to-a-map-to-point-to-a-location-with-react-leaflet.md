Time to add our first location to the map! For that, we'll need **latitude** and **longitude**of that location.

🤓 A quick refresher, [what are latitude and longitude?](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system)(and is it possible to spell those two words correctly?😅)

Then we'll add the **marker** - that's the pin that _marks_ the location on the map.

We'll also add a **popup** with more information.

👍 Both `<Marker>` and `<Popup>` components conveniently ship with react-leaflet library.
