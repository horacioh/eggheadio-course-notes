# Lesson 1 - A Little Overview About Maps

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-lesson-1---a-little-overview-about-maps)**

Mapping applications are in essence like a JAMstack app, they have:

- **JavaScript** (for running the mamping library)
- **API** (accessing the map API for imagery)
- **Markup** (the final output of our app will be HTML)

In this course, we'll be a building restaurant locator ðŸ’ª complete with popups, delivery radius and the ability to add a marker for your current location.
