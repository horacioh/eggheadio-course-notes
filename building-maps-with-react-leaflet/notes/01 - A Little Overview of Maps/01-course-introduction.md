**Objectives 🧐**

Throughout this course we'll be building a Restaurant Locator and using Leaflet to display the different locations on a map.

How?

- We'll be using a `create-react-app` starter template
- The super-popular mapping library called **Leaflet** (say goodbye to `iframes` 👋!)
- We'll be saving map data in a format called [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format

Instructions:

- 💻 clone the [starter template](https://github.com/colbyfayock/launchtime-workshop)
- Get a ☕ or 🍵 going 🎉

👍 Note: you might want to just watch the whole course once to get a feel for the pace and the structure. Once you're ready, make sure to install the template and follow along!

Once you've cloned the project repository, don't forget to install the dependencies and then run the server.

If you're using `yarn`:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn develop`

Make sure to `cd` into one of the ten lessons!
