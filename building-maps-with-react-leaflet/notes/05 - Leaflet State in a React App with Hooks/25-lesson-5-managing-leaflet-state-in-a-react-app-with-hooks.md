# Lesson 5 - Managing Leaflet State in a React App with Hooks

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-lesson-5---managing-leaflet-state-in-a-react-app-with-hooks)**

Time for some React Hooks!

We'll be using `useRef` to access the Leaflet API directly.

We'll fire up the `ref` with `useEffect` - timing it **after** the component was rendered!

We'll also be creating a new marker instance!

Then a quick debugging session demonstrating how the state can get out of sync (between Leaflet and the app).
