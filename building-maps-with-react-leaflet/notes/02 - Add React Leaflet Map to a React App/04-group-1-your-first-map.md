If you're interested in maps and want to know more about the struggles of representing Earth in a 2D map, check out the 6-min video [Why all world maps are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ) by Vox. Super-quick summary of the struggle: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form of distortion.

ðŸ¤“ or if you are a West Wing fan (guilty!) You can watch this [Why are we changing maps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqC3FNNOaI) clip instead.
