💻 If you are ever lost, go to [starter template](https://github.com/colbyfayock/launchtime-workshop), open `lessons/02 - Adding Your First React Leaflet Map to a New React Application`

Run:

`npm install leaflet react-leaflet # npm` OR

`yarn add leaflet react-leaflet # Yarn`

to add the two dependencies to our project

👍 Note: if you are coding along you should be installing the two dependencies in: `02 - Adding Your First React Leaflet Map to a New React Application` directory

👍 Note: React-Leaflet provides an abstraction of Leaflet as React components (For example: `Map`, `Marker`, `Popup`, `TileLayer`). In other words, even though we'll be using React, you'll still need the base Leaflet library to go along with React-Leaflet.
