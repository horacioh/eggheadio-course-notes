# Lesson 3 - Customizing Your React Leaflet Map with a Mapbox Basemap Style

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-lesson-3---customizing-your-react-leaflet-map-with-a-mapbox-basemap-style)**

Time to customize our map with Mapbox Studio ðŸ’ª!

To do that, we'll need an API Key.

To generate a custom map, you'll need the following 3 things:

1. A map style (from Mapbox Studio)
2. The ID of that map style
3. API Key (saved in an `env` variable is best)

ðŸ¤“ Did you know that while Mapbox.com is a commercial platform, most of their projects are open source? In Mapbox you are essentially paying for data hosting, servers and API access.
