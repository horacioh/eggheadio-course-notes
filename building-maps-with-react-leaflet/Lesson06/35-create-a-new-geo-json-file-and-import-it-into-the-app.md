Our Launch app is still rather _dumb_, let's fix that by loading GeoJSON data, instead of inputting the coordinates manually.

In the `src` directory, create a new **data** folder. Inside create a `locations.json` file.

Copy the data from geojson.io to the `locations` file and then import the `locations` file to `App.js`.

Like so:

`import locations from './data/locations.json';`
