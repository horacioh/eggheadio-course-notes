[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is a JSON document intended specifically for handling map data.

🤓 Specifically:
"GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. Geometric objects with additional properties are Feature objects. Sets of features are contained by FeatureCollection objects."

👍 Note GeoJSON is supposed to be an object, and not an array of objects.
