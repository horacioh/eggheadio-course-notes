We'll be replacing the default marker with `utensils-marker` found in the shared assets folder.

First, let's add a new property to our GeoJSON object (inside `App.js`) called `pointToLayer`.

Initialize the markers with:

```js
  pointToLayer: (feature, latlng) => {
    return L.marker(latlng);
  },
```
