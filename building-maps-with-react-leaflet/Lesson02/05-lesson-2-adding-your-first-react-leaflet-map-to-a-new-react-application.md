# Lesson 2 - Adding Your First React Leaflet Map to a New React Application

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-lesson-2---adding-your-first-react-leaflet-map-to-a-new-react-application)**

This lesson consists of two exercises:

- adding the two dependencies to our project
- adding a map to the project

The two main components of a React Leaflet map will be:

- A `<Map/>` component
- A `<TileLayer />` component

We'll do most of our work in the following two files:

- `App.js`
- `App.css`
