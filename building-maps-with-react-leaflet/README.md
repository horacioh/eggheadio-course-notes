## About üîç

This repo contains notes from [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock)'s Egghead Collection [Building Maps with React-Leaflet](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-course-introduction-00086daf).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each video in the course. However, because the videos are rather short (and there's over 60 of them), I've further grouped them into 10 directories (or lessons). Colby further bundles the videos into 3 major groups.

So 1 video collection -> 3 groups -> 10 lessons -> many exercises -> 61 videos!

I wanted to avoid creating subdirectories, so I kept the 10 lesson structure.

## Course Objective üí™

The main goal of this course is to create a simple restaurant locator app!

On this journey we will also:

- Learn what the Leaflet mapping library is and what it does
- Add a map to a `create-react-app` project using `React-Leaflet`
- Learn about `Map`, `TileLayer`, `Marker` and `Popup` components
- Learn about Mapbox
- Learn about GeoJSON
- Learn about Leaflet API

## ü§ì Notes on the notes:

This is a really well structured and super beginner-friendly course. Some prior knowledge of React is recommended, but not required.

If you are a less experienced developer, I recommend watching the course twice: just watch it once then code-along for the second time around.

If you are slightly more advanced, I'd suggest to try and complete the exercises before watching the course for solutions. You'll find Colby's comments instructing you what needs doing sprinkled throughout the codebase.

I didn't have any experience with creating maps beforehand, and this course served as a great introduction. Colby is very intentional in his teaching and expertly mixes new content with exercises, reviews, and deliberate practice, which results in a great learning experience.

I enjoyed it thoroughly and I hope you do too! Eva Dee ‚úèÔ∏è
